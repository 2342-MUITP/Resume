<h2>About myself</h2>
<p>A cheerful, talkative, confident girl with far ranging interests from writing songs to modelling to playing basketball /squash , running marathons to choregraphing while also making mark in the academic and professional field. 
    Being a Sports player throughout and also Sports Captain of my school in the graduating year has equipped me with sense of leadership, collaboration, passion, balanced approach and team handling skills which I consider as my forte and life skill .
    I have always loved to delve into multiple things and thus as I enter into the next phase of my life (College)- I have chosen to pursue UG course in Tech and Management which gives me wings to fly high and in different directions. Areas that I want to explore and excel are Finance, Start ups, Investment Banking, Data Analytics, Block chain, Artificial intelligence , Capital market and Stock trading. Looking forward to opportunities of mutual interest.</p>
